## Hi there! 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Universe 🚀
### About Me 🧙‍♂️

> "Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer." – Me, at 3 AM.

### I'm a code alchemist(always working on it) who loves to turn ideas into innovative solutions. Whether it's solving programming problems, crafting compelling presentations. I'm always up for a challenge.

### What I Do 💻
* Programming & Problem-Solving: I love diving into complex problems and emerging victorious (most of the time).
* Presentation Wizardry: Because a great idea deserves a great story.
* Reality Distortion Fields: It’s a fancy way of saying I’m good at making the impossible seem possible.

### Current Projects 🌟(working)
* Robotics Simulations with CoppeliaSim: Exploring the world of robotics—without breaking real hardware!

### Skills & Tools 🛠️
* Languages: Python, JavaScript(little bit), C, Rust(just landed), and more.
* Frameworks: Pytorch, Numpy, Plotly and some scientific tools, Flask, Express and React.
* Tools: VSCode, Jupyter, GitHub, and a reliable cup of coffee.

### My Philosophy 🤔
* Code should be clean, not just functional.
* A good bug report is worth its weight in gold.
* If at first you don’t succeed, rm -rf node_modules and try again.
