## Hi there! 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Universe 🚀
### About Me 🧙‍♂️
<!--
> "Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer." – Me, at 3 AM.

### I’m a curious coder who loves turning ideas into reality—solving problems, creating cool projects, and adding a little magic along the way.

### What I Do 💻
* Programming & Problem-Solving: I love diving into complex problems and emerging victorious (most of the time).
* Presentation Wizardry: Because a great idea deserves a great story.
<!--
### Current Projects 🌟(working)
* Robotics Simulations with CoppeliaSim: Exploring the world of robotics—without breaking real hardware!
-->
### Skills & Tools 🛠️
* Languages: Python, JavaScript(little bit), C, Rust(just landed), and more.
* Frameworks: Pytorch, Numpy, Plotly and some scientific tools, Flask, Express and React.
* Tools: VSCode, Jupyter, GitHub, and a reliable cup of coffee.

> P.S. If something catches your eye, give it a star! It's like sending a little wave across the internet. 🌟
<!--
### My Philosophy 🤔
* Code should be clean, not just functional.
* A good bug report is worth its weight in gold.
* If at first you don’t succeed, rm -rf node_modules and try again.
